fix(raffles): prevent blank list on mobile, add debug panel and resilient UI

Root cause: Server-side getRaffles() returned [] on error (e.g. RLS/403 or
missing Supabase config), so the page could not distinguish "error" from
"empty". If the server threw or client received undefined props, the UI could
render blank (header/footer only). No wallet filter was applied to the public
list — confirmed; only admin views filter by wallet.

What changed:
- getRaffles() now returns { data, error } so callers can show error vs empty.
- Raffles page: try/catch and config check; on fetch error pass initialError
  to client so an error card is shown instead of blank or silent empty.
- Added app/raffles/loading.tsx so "Loading raffles..." shows while server
  fetches (no blank during load).
- RafflesPageClient: defensive [] for props; error card with message + code +
  "Try again"; empty state "No active raffles yet" + Refresh button.
- Debug panel: ?debug=1 shows wallet (truncated), hostname, fetch status,
  error message/code, raffles count. No secrets. Client log only when ?debug=1.
- Removed noisy console.log in RafflesList (handleRaffleDeleted).
- API route and admin/verify-by-tx updated to use getRaffles() result shape.
- Runtime Supabase check: config error shows "Missing Supabase config" (no
  env values in UI).

How to verify on mobile:
1. Connect wallet on mobile.
2. Open /raffles (or / which redirects to /raffles).
3. Expect: list of raffles, or "No active raffles yet" + Refresh, or clear
   error card with "Try again". No blank screen.
4. Optional: add ?debug=1 to URL to see diagnostics (wallet truncated,
   hostname, fetch status, error if any, count).
